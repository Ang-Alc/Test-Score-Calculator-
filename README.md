# Test Score Calculator

This program’s purpose is to display the minimum, maximum and average grade of 5 test scores and display the letter grade associated with the test scores.

## Description

The program will ask for 5 integers and will individually check if each integer is in the range of 0 – 100. If not in this range of 0-100, display a message indicating an error and end the program. If the inputs are valid, the program will check each input to categorize them in the ranges of 0 – 50, 60 – 69, 70 – 79, 80 – 89, and 90 – 100 to give each test score the appropriate letter grade. Once the program receives the 5 inputs, it begins the calculations of minimum, maximum, and average. The program displays the results on the console and ends the program.

## Project Requirements

The program must fulfill the following criteria:
1.	Contain appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output. (20 points)
2.	Display minimum, max, average values/grades in console. (20 points)
3.	Use appropriate labels and comments. (20 points)
4.	Contain appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations. (40 points)
5.	Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls. (20 points)
6.	Use branching for control: conditional and iterative. (30 points)
7.	Manage overflow and storage allocation. (20 points)
8.	Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack. (20 points)
9.	Include save-restore operations. (30 points)
10.	Include pointer (20 points)
11.	Implement ASCII conversion operations (30 points)
12.	Use appropriate system call directives. (10 point)
13.	Testing (20 points): Test the program using the below values

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This program was developed and tested using the LC-3 Assembler and Simulator Software for Windows found [HERE](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html) 

If not on Windows, there are online simulators ([lcrweb](https://wchargin.com/lc3web/) and [lc3tutor](http://lc3tutor.org/)) to run the code and display the console.


### Executing program

* Download .asm file from this repo
* Open .asm file in the LC-3 Editor
* Assemble the file
* Open LC-3 Simulator
* Open the .obj file created from assembling
* Run the program and follow prompts on console
